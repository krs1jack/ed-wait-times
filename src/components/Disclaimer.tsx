        <strong>About Wait Time Estimates:</strong> The average wait times provided by hospital
        systems are typically based on a rolling average (often two hours) and are updated
        approximately every 15-30 minutes. Estimated wait times generally reflect the time from
        check-in to care being initiated by a doctor, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Individual Results May Vary:</strong> Since no two people—and no two injuries
        or illnesses—are alike, your actual wait time may be longer or shorter than the times
        displayed. Many factors can cause wait times to change rapidly and without notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Emergency Prioritization:</strong> Top priority will always be given to patients
        affected by life-threatening illness or injury, regardless of arrival time. This is
        standard medical triage protocol and may affect wait times for other patients.
